# Turing-Morphogenesis
Matlab implementation of a solver for time-dependent partial differential equations with Neumann boundary conditions.  More specifically, this code has been applied to the reaction-diffusion equations from Turing's Morphogenesis model.  This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of these experiments and a pdf report.
